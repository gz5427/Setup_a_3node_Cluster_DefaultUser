Setup a 3-Node Cluster from Scratch

This is to start a 3-node cluster using Amazon EC2 machine using "ubuntu" as a user across the 3 machines.   
I wrote a 3-part files explaining what steps need to take for a person who is totally new to Amazon EC2 can 
learn how to set up a 3-node Hadoop cluster.   Here are the 3 steps I constructed:

Step 1: Learn to setup Amazon EC2 Ubuntu machines.  This includes the tools needed such as PuTTY, PuTTYGen, WinSCP etc.
Step 2: Create user hduser, setup keyless ssh from each machine to the other 2 machines.
Step 3. Download the Hadoop file, the java library and Prepare all the needed files for Hadoop cluster.
